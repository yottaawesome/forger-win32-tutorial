# theForger's Win32 API Tutorial

## Introduction

This repository is an unofficial repo for [theForger's Win32 API Tutorial](http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/) [source code](http://bit.ly/2ntziDq). It's reproduced here so I don't forget about it and so I can easily reference it using Git.

## Changes

The solution and projects have been upgraded to VS 2019 Community Edition, and the source code successfully compiles, but outdated compiler and linker flags will generate warnings during builds. I will update the flags soon.
